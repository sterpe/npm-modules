fizzbuzz-stream
===============

it implements a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.  But for
mulitples of three it prints "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples
of five it prints "Buzz" instead.

for number which are both multiples of three and five it prints "FizzBuzz".

it was written in ed.
oh it's a readable stream, too.
